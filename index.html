   Programming Journal
   
   This site documents my journey into open source programming starting around the year 2020.  Mainly it lets me organize and 
   document whatever I've learned along the way.  It is somewhat like a blog but with updated posts, so the posts are not kept in date 
   order, but rather topical order.

   I organize it as a blog with time-sequenced articles, but also have an input queue for things I consider
   a possibility to blog about.  At some point, I intend to organize certain posts into a more topical order.
   Thus, I dub it a journal.

   **Philosophy:**  Open source all the way and [free/libre](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).  From the Operating System to various utilities, the articles
   herein heavily favor open source solutions.  Linux itself is largely unfamiliar to me, so I am learning that
   too.

   **Requisites**  If you're as new to this as I am, you can follow along in my footsteps and let me make the mistakes
   ahead of you.  If you're already ahead of me, this journal may be relatively worthless to you.  That said, the articles
   below are geared towards the following:

   * Linux flavor: [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) / Ubuntu / [PureOS](https://www.pureos.net/) / maybe even [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/)
   * Editor: [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or VSCode, and maybe [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
   * Languages: [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 
     and Javascript or maybe [Nim](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25590962)
   * Version Control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
   * Security: [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/) and maybe [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) but [probably not](https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-encrypted-messaging-apps/keybase/)

Raw Input Queue
=================================================================
Topics I am reading or thinking about that may or may not make it into future articles.

Journal System (this site)
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Don't break links to blog articles from initial editing through final publishing and maintenance cycle
* Collect all thoughts or reference materials
* Input queue as an organization tool
* Guides as blog articles reassembled into an overall organized book

Development Environment
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Selecting a Linux Flavor and Desktop for Development - Hint: Debian or maybe PureOS with Gnome and VSCodium, with a discussion of Guix
* Putting your Linux Development Environment on a USB Stick - Keeping your development environment separate is a good idea for security and clarity. 
* Installing the VSCodium Code Editor
* WebAssembly Studio: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25592481

Coding
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Knuth Literate Programming vs. Uncle Bob "no comment" style
  * Uncle Bob: 
    * Code changes, comments become obsolete; 
    * Use more declarative variable names: long, descriptive names for broad scope, i, j, k for loops
  * Experts vs. non-experts
  * Things that make sense to comment
    * Config Files 
    * HTML links to manuals/guides, bugs
  * Rust can combine documentation with code: best of both worlds?  

Command Line
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Keybase as a command line argument model
