                      **Markdeep Feature Demo**
                           Morgan McGuire

This demonstration documents the features of
[Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep) and acts as a test for
it.  Markdeep is a text formatting syntax that extends Markdown, and a
Javascript program for making it work in browsers. The two most
powerful features are its ability to run in any **web browser** on the
client side and the inclusion of **diagrams**.
