   Programming Journal
   
   This site documents my journey into open source programming starting around the year 2020.  Mainly it lets me organize and 
   document whatever I've learned along the way.  It is somewhat like a blog but with updated posts, so the posts are not kept in date 
   order, but rather topical order.

   I organize it as a blog with time-sequenced articles, but also have an input queue for things I consider
   a possibility to blog about.  At some point, I intend to organize certain posts into a more topical order.
   Thus, I dub it a journal.

   **Philosophy:**  Open source all the way and [free/libre](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).  From the Operating System to various utilities, the articles
   herein heavily favor open source solutions.  Linux itself is largely unfamiliar to me, so I am learning that
   too.

   **Requisites**  If you're as new to this as I am, you can follow along in my footsteps and let me make the mistakes
   ahead of you.  If you're already ahead of me, this journal may be relatively worthless to you.  That said, the articles
   below are geared towards the following:

   * Linux flavor: [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) / Ubuntu / [PureOS](https://www.pureos.net/) / maybe even [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/)
   * Editor: [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or VSCode, and maybe [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
   * Languages: [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 
     and Javascript or maybe [Nim](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25590962)
   * Version Control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
   * Security: [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/) and maybe [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) but [probably not](https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-encrypted-messaging-apps/keybase/)
