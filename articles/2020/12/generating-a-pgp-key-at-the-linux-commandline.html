Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) has been around forever.  It has a reputation 
of being hard to use and even [experienced techies abandon it](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/12/op-ed-im-giving-up-on-pgp/) 
for it's original purpose of encrypting messages.

As far as I can tell, though, it's the defacto standard for digitally
signing code and binaries as authentic and is utilized by Github, despite
some [embarrassing vulnerabilities](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/decades-old-pgp-bug-allowed-hackers-to-spoof-just-about-anyones-signature/?itm_source=parsely-api)
exposed and fixed a couple of years ago.

Requirements
==============================================================

* email address 
* [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/) installed:

For Debian/Ubuntu/PureOS/Kali and derivatives:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~bash
sudo apt-get install gpg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generate a GPG Key
==============================================================

Create a passphrase for your GPG Key beforehand and store in your
password manager - unless you are creating a GPG Key for your password manager!
In that case, make one up, and make it strong.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
gpg --full-generate-key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is an error, try again, making sure you type your 
password correctly at the pop-up. You should see a dialog something like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 
Requested keysize is 3072 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Joe Schmoe
Email address: JoeSchmoe@fakeemail.com
Comment: Password Storage Key
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Joe Schmoe (Password Storage Key) <JoeSchmoe@fakeemail.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
